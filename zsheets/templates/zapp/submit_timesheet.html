=======
This would need some kind of form for creating a timesheet, maybe follow a similar pattern to what is on the admin pages for
creating a timesheet.
Timesheets have a field approved_status which by default I think is set to False automatically if I have done things right.
I believe there is a way to automatically get a form from a given model using Django's built in stuff, I'll look this up.
